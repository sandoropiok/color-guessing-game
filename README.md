## üëÄ Project Overview

The Color Guessing Game generates random colors for a grid of squares and challenges the player to pick the correct color based on an RGB value displayed at the top. When the player guesses correctly, the page color changes to indicate success. This project helps reinforce fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.

## üíª Features

- **Random Color Generation:** Each game round generates a new set of colors for the squares, including one "correct" color to guess.
- **Two Difficulty Levels:** Easy mode displays three squares, while Hard mode displays six squares.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Players receive visual and textual feedback when they guess correctly or incorrectly.
- **Reset Functionality:** Players can reset the game to get new colors without reloading the page.

## üöÄ How to Play

1. The RGB value of the target color is displayed at the top of the page.
2. Choose a difficulty level by selecting either the "Easy" or "Hard" button:
   - **Easy:** Only 3 squares are displayed.
   - **Hard:** All 6 squares are displayed.
3. Click on one of the colored squares to guess the color.
   - If correct, all squares change to the target color, the message "CORRECT!" appears, and the page header changes to the correct color.
   - If incorrect, the square clicked disappears, and the message "TRY AGAIN" appears.
4. Click "New Colors" to start a new game with different colors.
